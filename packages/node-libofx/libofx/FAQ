INSTALL:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure you have the OpenSP library installed (libosp.so) before compiling.  Yo can grab it at http://openjade.sourceforge.net/
The recommended version is OpenSP 1.5
If you have a version of OpenJade or OpenSP already installed before compiling OpenSP, make sure that you use ./configure --prefix=/usr to build OpenSP.  Otherwise, LibOFX will probably link with the older, incompatible version of OpenSP.

Then type:
./autogen.sh (For libofx CVS)
./configure (For a distributed tarball)
make
And as root type:
make install

LibOFX <==> OpenSP compatibility matrix:
OpenSP version               Status
1.3.4 (included in most      NOT COMPATIBLE
distro with OpenJADE 1.3.1)  OpenSP doesn't parse OFX files correctly
                             LibOFX < 0.23 will probably only output garbage.
1.4                          NOT TESTED
1.5pre5                      COMPATIBLE with all versions
1.5pre8                      COMPATIBLE with LibOFX >= 0.23
1.5                          COMPATIBLE with LibOFX >= 0.23

FAQ:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Getting "configure: error: unable to link a test program, is OpenSP installed?"

-BE CAREFULL:  When you compile OpenSP, by default it will install in /usr/local.  On many versions of linux (Most RedHat, All Mandrake up to 8.3) /usr/local/lib/ is not part of /etc/ld.so.conf .  In this case LibOFX will either
1-Fail to link at all
2-Link with libosp.so.0 (1.3.4, wich probably got installed as part of OpenJade) and not work.
Even if you add /usr/local/lib/ to /etc/ld.so.conf, LibOFX will probably still link with OpenSP 1.3.4 at runtime.  Symptoms will be complaints of many unclosed statements when running ofxdump on an ofx file.

I STRONGLY URGE YOU to avoid theese problems and compile OpenSP using
 ./configure --prefix=/usr
If you really want to install OpenSP in /usr/local/lib, you must add --with-opensp-libs=/usr/local/lib to libofx's ./configure or ./autogen.sh


(2) Problems compiling OpenSP 1.4

If you are getting errors like:
../include/Message.h:157: `class OpenSP::Messenger' is inaccessible nsgmls.cxx:60: within this context)

Try to change private to protected in file OpenSP-1.4/nsgmls/RasEventHandler.h, on line 105.

(3) ofxdump does now work right.  It seems some values are cut in half, or one out of two letter is missing.

LibOFX must know if OpenSP's was compiled with SP_MULTI_BYTE defined.  The default is to assume that it was.  If you see things such as "SAEET" instead of "STATEMENT" in ofxdump's output, try the following:
You can force libofx to assume that OpenSP was NOT compiled with SP_MULTI_BYTE defined by using:
./configure --with-no-opensp-multibyte
or for CVS:
./autogen.sh --with-no-opensp-multibyte

Unfortunately, the auto-detection of this option was too fragile to release, because distros do not always distribute the config.h OpenSP was truly compiled with.  If the devel package for opensp was not compiled at the same time as the lib, it may give wrong value.
